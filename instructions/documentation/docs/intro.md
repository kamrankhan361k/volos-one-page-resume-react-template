# Getting Started

We will start by installing the template and running it on a local computer.

## Requirments

Make sure you have `npm` and `nodejs` installed on your device.

```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

We used npm version **9.1.3** and used nodejs version **18.12.1**.

:::caution
Don't use old versions like nodejs v14 as it may cause some errors.
:::

## Install Template Packages

Go to the template folder **./volos_react_template** and run `npm install`

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the template packages you can preview the template on your computer.

Write `npm run dev` in the terminal and then you will see the website life from the following link `http://localhost:5173/volos-react`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Next ?

After we installed the template dependencies and opened it on a computer, let's see how to customize it.
